"# Marvel-Cinematic-Universe" 
This is My Marvel Cinematic Universe Ionic Application.<br>
I couldnt upload all in the 1 project as there were too many<br>
files. This App focuses on the Marvel Cinematic Universe and <br>
which movies to watch in order. I chose to do this app as iam <br>
a huge fan of the Marvel films and think the timing of doing this<br>
app with the Release of Avengers: Infinity War it was an ideal time<br>
to do this app based on the MCU. 
<br>
<br>
Starting off this project i started it wrong hence 2 repositories.<br>
Starting again i set up the home.html and home.ts file then adding each<br>
import to the app.module.ts. I used the gernerate ionic command to create<br>
the .ts and .html fles for each page, i found this a quick and easy way to<br>
read in the imports to the app.module.ts. 
<br>
<br>
I used a nav bar to switch inbetween views/pages which<br>
makes the app nice and smooth when run. Theres a nice integration<br>
between the pages. I also used a normal img tag as the ion-img tag<br>
didnt look how i wanted as it had a grey area on the border. This didnt<br>
make the app look good it looked quite stupid. I also used the img tag for<br>
the differnt movies to click on instead of sticking to one click way of using<br>
buttons in which i used in the home page.
<br>
<br>
I wasn't successful as i hoped to be with calling an API into this App<br>
but overall iam happy with the alternative i used, using links to other<br>
sites Zavvi and HMV to buy the marvel movies. Marvel Entertainment for the<br>
official website. I also used youtube links for trailers and Rotten Tomatoes<br>
links for the movie reviews.I used a simple href tag which i was thought in <br>
first year in html and css.
<br>
<br>
Iam happy with my work and my app when produced. I used what i knew<br>
to create this app, at risk of it not working even looked up i left out<br>
API as i wasn't able to call one in. This was dissapointing however im overwhelmed<br>
with my app and since iam a huge marvel fan i couldnt be happier.
